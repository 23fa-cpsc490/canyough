a very good day to you everyone. today i want to tell you about a video game i recently played by the name of Persona 4. it's a very good game. i was very lonely, because i have no friends in real life, but persona 4 has finally allowed me to live in the world of my own kawaii japanese high school, and reach out to the truth. i'd also like to state, that Chee is objectively the best girl, and i’d fill our many steaks with love if she was real. on the other hand, i must sadly say that people who like Risette have absolutely poor taste in women.

tairone, you ahre, bu’ casual scum. why dontch you play a real shin megoomi tensay gaem, loike Nocturne or Schange Joruney. persona 4 is a casuals' dating sim that panders to lonely waifufags.

i play Persona 4 for the visual novel elements. i only want to feel good with virtual friends in a comfortable atmosphere. shin megami tensei, and persona, one two, are unappealing to me, as they're too hahdcore, with their ah-pg dungeon crawling. plus, my beloved waifu Chee, only exists within the Persona universe. you're free to enjoy smt, but i think i'll stick to persona.

visuals novels ah’r shit i’ll b’here foiting angels in the name of chaos, while you cling to Chee. can you even take on the ahmies of why 8ch vee 8ch and fight in the name of chaos? i’ll bet you dream of holding Chee's hand instead of claiming the world in lucifer's own glory. do you even dungeon crawling? try not to feel too bad, but, the objective best waifu in the entoire series is actually louisa ferre, from Strange Joruney, and Chee is but a bake-a and unpure gurl compared to her–this is rog signing out, and remember, let's positive thinking.
